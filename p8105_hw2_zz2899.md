## Problem 1

``` r
#Read and clean the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet
trash_data <- 
  #read the excel and let it contain data entries only
  read_excel("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", sheet = 1, range = "A2:N408")%>%
  #use reasonable variable names
  janitor::clean_names()%>%
  #omit rows that do not include dumpster-specific data
  drop_na(dumpster)%>%
  #round the number of sports balls to the nearest integer
  mutate(sports_balls = round(sports_balls, digits = 0))
```

``` r
#Read and clean precipitation data for 2018
pre2018 <- 
  read_excel("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", sheet = 5, range = "A2:B14")%>%
  #omit rows without precipitation data
  drop_na(Total)%>%
  #add a variable for year
  mutate(year = 2018)

#Read and clean precipitation data for 2019
pre2019 <- 
  read_excel("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", sheet = 4, range = "A2:B14")%>%
  #omit rows without precipitation data
  drop_na(Total)%>%
  #add a variable for year
  mutate(year = 2019)

#combine precipitation datasets
pre_data <- 
  bind_rows(pre2018, pre2019)%>%
  #convert month to a character variable
  mutate(Month = month.name[Month])
```

The data set `trash_data` has 14 observations including the dumpster,
month, year, date, weight\_tons, volume\_cubic\_yards, plastic\_bottles,
polystyrene, cigarette\_butts, glass\_bottles, grocery\_bags,
chip\_bags, sports\_balls, homes\_powered. It has a total of 344 rows
and 14 columns. `month` is a character variable (e.g. “January”,
“February”, “March”), `year` is a numeric variable (e.g. 2017), the
variable `date` looks like yyyy-mm-dd, `weight_tons` is a numeric
variable accurate to two decimal places, `homes_powered` is a numeric
variable accurate to five decimal places, other variables are all
numeric variables of integers. The data set `pre_data` has 3
observations including the Month, Total, year. It has a total of 18 rows
and 3 columns. `month` is a character variable (e.g. “January”,
“February”, “March”), `year` is a numeric variable that only contains
2018 and 2019, and `Total` is a numeric variable accurate to two decimal
places.

For available data, total precipitation in 2018 is 70.33, and the median
number of sports balls in a dumpster in 2019 is 8.5.
